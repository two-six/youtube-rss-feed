# Introduction

YT-Feeder is a Rofi-Based RSS Reader made specifically for YouTube video platform. It&rsquo;s written purely in bash and allows user to watch or download new videos.

# Usage

While in the project folder:

```bash
chmod +x YT-Feeder
```

Then to actually run the script:

```bash
rofi -show YT-Feeder -modi "YT-Feeder:/Absolute/Path/To/YT-Feeder"
```

I highly suggest binding the above command to your keyboard shortcut of choice. After launch you can select your favorite channel from the list, then select video and then you have a choice to:

-   watch(best) -> watch it in the best quality
-   watch(worst) -> watch it in the worst quality
-   play in the background -> play audio from video in the background
-   open in a web browser -> opens YouTube link in a default web browser
-   download -> download video
-   download audio -> download audio from video
-   command -> use your custom command on video&rsquo;s link

There&rsquo;s also an option to refresh the RSS feeds at the top of the list and there might be an option to stop currently playing audio in the background(only after selecting &ldquo;play in the background&rdquo;).

## Worth noting

The default directory for downloaded videos is ~/Videos/ and the default directory for downloaded audio is ~/Music/.

# Configuration

Change ~/.config/yt-feeder/config file to configure this script. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, create it. The general syntax for this file is:

```
// Some comment
rss link or channel's ID
rss link or channel's ID
rss link or channel's ID
DOWNLOAD|~/Videos/folder_for_yt_videos
COMMAND|my_custom_command
DOWNLOAD_AUDIO|~/Music/folder_for_yt_audio
```

Comments must be placed on separate lines, every line starting with &ldquo;//&rdquo; will be ignored by the script

-   `DOWNLOAD` specifies the custom directory where you wish to download your videos.
-   `COMMAND` specifies your custom command to use on youtube links.
-   `DOWNLOAD_AUDIO` specifies the custom directory where you wish to download your audio.
